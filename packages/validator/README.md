# @e-rechnung/validator

EN 16931 validation rule engine for the E-Rechnung Tool.

## Overview

This package implements a comprehensive validation engine for e-invoices according to the EN 16931 standard subset defined in our MVP requirements.

## Features

- **Pure Functions**: All validation rules are deterministic with no I/O
- **Stable Rule IDs**: Rule codes (e.g., INV-01) are immutable once published
- **Severity Levels**: FAIL (block auto-archive) vs WARN (highlight in reports)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Core invoice fields, currency, totals, line items, parties, tax
